## My meme

"My meme" is one of those final scenes from the movie Casablanca. 
The meme itself and the culture of meme are very new to me. 
I have not get used to or familiar with it. Therefor I have chosen the meme from one of my favorite movies to start with.

## My animated GIF

The meme called "a rocky planet" just caught my attention at the first glance and along with other three memes. I think this may be a kind of humor rather than too serious as "My meme" above.

```{css}
